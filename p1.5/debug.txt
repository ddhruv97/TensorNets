Things to check:
Do the energy in a more efficient way
(but this won't necessarily change the number that comes out)

Next suggestion - 
try more steps - if you segfault then there may be some other issue
does on of them have the wrong number of things? Anything missing site index?
Write a helper that calculates the norm manucally, rather than relying on the orthogonality property
change T and steps
set dmrg maxm
